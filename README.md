The project provides a **symbolic and graph-theoretical framework** for automatically generating and evaluating the analytical contributions of **many-body Feynman diagrams** at **finite temperature**, within the **finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory (FT-MBPT)** formalism.

At a given perturbative order ( n ), the program performs the following tasks:

* Draws each Feynman diagram.
* Displays the corresponding **symmetry factors** along with the potential contributions.
* Prints the analytical expression of the **grand potential** ( \Omega_n ).

The code systematically generates the symbolic expressions of the grand potential for both **fermionic** and **bosonic** systems.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

You can run the program locally **or directly in Google Colab**.
